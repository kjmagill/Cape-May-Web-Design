## ✨ Key Features

- **Interactive Contact Form:** A client-side validated contact form with clear user feedback for idle, submitting, success, and error states.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React, the UI is organized into reusable, self-contained components for easy maintenance and scalability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is set up to be run with a simple static server.

### Prerequisites

You will need a local web server to handle module resolution correctly. The popular `live-server` extension in VS Code or any other static file server will work.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cape-may-web-design.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cape-may-web-design
    ```

3.  **Start a local server:**
    If you have `live-server` installed via npm (`npm install -g live-server`), you can simply run:
    ```bash
    live-server
    ```
    Alternatively, open the project folder in VS Code and use the "Go Live" button from the Live Server extension.

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    The server will automatically open a new tab in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or a similar address).
